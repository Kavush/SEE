# 🎉 Fun Calculator 🎮

A simple yet powerful Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations with style! ✨

## 📝 Description

This Fun Calculator allows you to input two numbers and get the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's designed with fun comments and emojis to make your coding experience more enjoyable! 😊

## 🛠️ Features

- ➕ Addition of two numbers
- ➖ Subtraction of two numbers
- ✖️ Multiplication of two numbers
- ➗ Division of two numbers (watch out for division by zero! 🚨)
- ✨ Fun and engaging output with emojis
- 🔢 Supports decimal numbers (float values)

## 🚀 How to Use
